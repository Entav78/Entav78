### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently studying Front End Development at Noroff.
- ⚡ Fun fact: German Shepherds have a unique "double coat," with a soft undercoat and a dense outer layer, which helps regulate their body temperature, keeping them warm in the winter and cool in the summer! Remember to get a vaccum cleaner that can handle this if you're thinking of getting German Shepherd!
